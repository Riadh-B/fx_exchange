Hereâ€™s a main README.md that covers all parts of the project, including Part A (PostgreSQL setup, data processing and scheduling with cron jobs), Part B (Partitioning and scheduling with cron jobs), and Part C (Real-time data streaming with Kafka and PostgreSQL). The guide also includes the use of configparser for secure credential management.

# FX Exchange Rates Database Project
This project is designed to manage and process high-frequency foreign exchange (FX) rates. It includes three main parts:

1. **Part A**: Initial FX rate processing using PostgreSQL.
2. **Part B**: Database partitioning and scheduled processing.
3. **Part C**: Real-time data streaming using Kafka and PostgreSQL, with secure configuration handling using configparser.

### Table of Contents
- **Part A**: Initial FX Rate Processing
- **Part B**: PostgreSQL Partitioning and Scheduling
- **Part C**: Real-Time Data Streaming with Kafka


### Summary of the Main README:

- The README covers all three parts of your project: **Part A**, **Part B**, and **Part C**.
- Each part includes instructions on how to set up and run the respective components.
- It also explains the **secure configuration** using `configparser` and how to set up PostgreSQL and Kafka.
